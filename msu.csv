The prelaw major is intended to give students the analytical skills and substantive background in those courses which will most likely contribute to their development.","[<Selector xpath='//*[@id=""MainContent_divDesc""]/div/div[2]/ol' data='<ol>\r\n\t<li>The University requirement...'>]",,

Students may also take elective courses at other medical schools or be placed in clinical settings other than those associated with Michigan State University.,From the first days of the curriculum, and at regular intervals throughout the curriculum, a suite of progress assessments enable students and their faculty to verify learners’ achievement of competence and readiness to advance.  Progress testing is a longitudinal competency assessment that facilitates adult lifelong learning and represents the College of Human Medicine’s graduation test for the M.D. degree.  Students take the progress suite assessment and move through the curriculum as they demonstrate competency.  With some slight variation for licensure preparation, every offering of the progress suite of assessments is equivalent and students are evaluated on these end-competency assessments many times in their College of Human Medicine career.,Pragmatism as an educational philosophical stance requires assessing thought, action and their interaction.  The curriculum utilizes a group of assessments that include the nationally-normed multiple choice examinations associated with a professional education but do not stop at the determination of simply what our learners “know.”  A core assessment is the Progress Clinical Skills Examination of actual performance with standardized patients. Other assessments in the suite include a multi-source rating by their faculty, peers, health care team members and actual patients which indicates what our College of Human Medicine students “do.”  Portfolios of evidence containing essays, multimedia, reflections, scholarly products and projects are regularly reviewed by faculty to assure that acquisition of the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes is taking place, and that learners can receive anticipatory guidance to achieve not only competence, but excellence. Ongoing data flow from these multiple types of assessments assures that students, faculty, staff, and administration are engaging in continuous quality improvement. Students are guided to focus on particular areas of challenge and opportunity.,Progress suite assessments are offered twice a semester to students of all levels of the curriculum.  Students are required to pass the progress suite of assessments in order to advance through the curriculum.,The College of Human Medicine Committee on Admissions strives to select qualified applicants who are academically, emotionally, motivationally, and socially competent and ready for the rigors of medical school and for a career in medicine. These competencies creates graduates who meet the bio-psycho-social needs of a diverse patient population. As a community-integrated medical school in Michigan, the college’s mission focuses on educating physicians to meet the primary health care needs of the people of Michigan, including the state’s underserved rural and inner-city areas. In preparation for serving a diverse patient population, the composition of the entering class of 190 students is representative of Michigan’s general population. Students come from a variety of cultural, geographic, and ethnic backgrounds. In recent history, women have comprised more than 50 percent, underrepresented minority students 20 to 25 percent, and Michigan residents 75 to 80 percent of the entering class. Since there is no preference for academic majors, applicants with varied academic backgrounds are represented in each entering class, including those with degrees in the natural sciences, applied sciences, arts, business, engineering, humanities, and social sciences.,The College of Human Medicine uses the primary application services available through the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). Applicants may contact their premedical advisor, or contact AMCAS at http: //www.aamc.org for application information. The Committee on Admissions encourages students to submit the AMCAS application in June of the year prior to anticipated enrollment, but no later than the November 1 deadline date. The Committee also requires that all applicants submit Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) scores. The MCAT is administered multiple times throughout the year. MCAT scores are valid for three years. For more information about the MCAT, applicants should contact their premedical advisors, or the MCAT Program Office at ,. For further information about the College of Human Medicine, request a copy of the ,, by contacting the College of Human Medicine at ,The admissions process will continue the college's traditional use of holistic review, which uses a balanced assessment of academic metrics, activities, and personal characteristics, and attributes when making admissions decisions.The College of Human Medicine Office of Admissions evaluates applicants’ AMCAS applications, including life experiences and personal statements, and letters of recommendation (personal characteristics and attributes), and academic profile (major, classes, GPA trends, MCAT scores, undergraduate institution). Admission officers from the admissions office act on direction from the admissions committee to evaluate the applications to determine the most qualified applicants to advance to the next phase of the admissions process, the interview. Students are invited to Interview Day to learn more about the College of Human Medicine through a series of highly-structured interviews and programs. Applicant interviews consists of a one-on-one interview with a medical students and a 100-minute, eight-station multiple mini-interview that incorporates faculty, staff, students, alumni, and other vested individuals. Interviewers are trained to assess applicants on the qualities the College associates with becoming exemplar physicians consistent with the mission of the college.,The Committee on Admissions makes the final admissions decisions based on the following cognitive and non-cognitive considerations:,Minimum requirements which must be fulfilled prior to enrollment in the program in human medicine are:, ","[<Selector xpath='//*[@id=""MainContent_divDesc""]/div/div[2]/ol' data='<ol>\r\n\t<li>Recruit students from dive...'>, <Selector xpath='//*[@id=""MainContent_divDesc""]/div/div[2]/ol' data='<ol>\r\n\t<li>Academic competence includ...'>, <Selector xpath='//*[@id=""MainContent_divDesc""]/div/div[2]/ol' data='<ol>\r\n\t<li>Be a U.S. or Canadian citi...'>]",,

and in the graduate–professional degree program in the College of Human Medicine.,The College of Social Science administers the specializations.  The specializations are supervised by an interdisciplinary faculty coordinating committee representing the graduate programs involved.  Students must meet the requirements of both the degree program and the specialization.  Students should work closely with their academic advisors to ensure that meaningful experiences that are directly related to applied developmental science are included in their degree programs.  With the approval of the department or school and college that administer the student's degree program, the courses that are used to satisfy the requirements for the specialization may also be used to satisfy the requirements for the student's degree program.  ,American society is faced with pervasive and burgeoning problems of individuals, families, and communities.  Issues of child and youth development, of economic competitiveness, of environmental quality, and of health and health care require creative research and the design, deployment, and evaluation of innovative public policies and intervention programs.  As a consequence, there has been increasing societal pressure for universities, and for the scholars within them, to design and deliver knowledge applications addressing these problems.,One of the most fruitful areas for such knowledge application involves examining the problems of individuals and communities across the life span.  These applications require the ability to understand and assist the development of individuals who vary with respect to cultural and ethnic background, economic and social opportunity, physical and cognitive abilities, and conditions of living.  Infants at biopsychosocial risk, gifted children or those with developmental disabilities, adolescents considering health–compromising behaviors, single– and dual–worker parents, the frail elderly, ethnic minorities, and impoverished families are just some of the populations requiring applications of knowledge based on the work of scholars in fields such as criminal justice, human nutrition, medicine, and psychology.  There is a need within those fields for scholars who adopt a development perspective to their science.,The five components of applied developmental science are described below:, theory deals with the continuities and discontinuities of development, i.e., with the process of change.  There is a temporal component to individual, family, institutional, and community experiences.  Some aspects of development remain stable over time; other aspects change.  Systems theory provides an approach to modeling stability and change, and to the identification of factors that causally influence organizational processes.  The temporality of change has important implications for research design, service provision, and program evaluation because it is dependent upon use of longitudinal methods and keyed by multivariate models of the developmental process., involves issues related to diversity, whether that diversity is generated by culture, gender, age, socioeconomic status, disability, race or ethnicity, or community.  All of those factors potentially affect individual differences among persons, families, communities, and neighborhoods and potentially contribute to program successes and failures.  Competence in diversity refers to a set of academic and interpersonal skills that allow individuals to increase their understanding and appreciation of cultural differences and similarities within, among, and between groups., involves the centrality of context in terms of individuals, families, and family functioning.  Context exists at all levels—biological, physical/ecological, social–cultural, political, economic, etc., and invites systemic approaches to research and program design and implementation.  Contextual variables such as poverty, family size, birth order, single parenthood, supplemental child care, parental psychopathology, unemployment, and workplace stress all help to set the context within which individuals, families, and social groups behave and develop., emphasizes identification of assets so that the capacity to act is strengthened at the most basic level possible, whether that level is the individual person, or a local school, human service agency, neighborhood, or community.  Applied developmental science stresses normative developmental processes as primary prevention rather than remediation.  It rejects deficit model approaches to individual and social preventive–interventions.  Universities exist to disseminate knowledge through instruction.  From an applied developmental science perspective, asset building requires the learner (community) to be implicitly involved in the development of educational programs so that there is an explicit match between educational materials and needs of the consumer., stresses the principle that models for community intervention must be tested in the community setting in full collaboration with community partners.  In short, communities must participate as full partners in the design and evaluation of community programs.  From this perspective, application of knowledge generates new questions that demand generation of new knowledge (i.e., new approaches, new strategies, new program designs).  The activities of applied developmental science span a continuum of knowledge generation to knowledge application which includes, but is not limited to, research on the applicability of scientific theory to human growth and development in ecologically valid contexts; the study of developmental correlates of phenomena of social import; the construction and utilization of developmentally and contextually sensitive assessment instruments; the design and evaluation of developmental interventions and enhancement programs; and the dissemination of developmental knowledge to individuals, families, communities, practitioners, and policymakers through developmental education, written materials, the mass media, expert testimony, and community collaborations.,All of these five components converge to a research environment that values longitudinal designs by which one can track individuals over time, assess normative trends, evaluate different contextual influences on intraindividual change as well as normative trends, and assess the dynamic bi–directional processes that regulate organization of individual, dyadic, family, and social systems.,The interdepartmental graduate specializations in applied developmental science are designed to provide a knowledge base that will facilitate the work of graduates who pursue careers in educational, agency, institutional, and governmental organizations that are integral to preventive–intervention programs, longitudinal studies of human development, and developmental evaluation.  Specifically, the specializations are designed to:,A student who is enrolled in one of the master's, Educational Specialist, doctoral, or graduate–professional degree programs referenced above and who wishes to complete the requirements for an Interdepartmental Graduate Specialization in Applied Developmental Science must petition the admission committee for the specialization for acceptance.  To be considered for acceptance into the specialization, the student should have completed the Graduate Record Examination including the Subject Test in the student's discipline.  To be accepted into the specialization, the student must have had academic preparation in experimental design and statistical analysis.  If in the judgment of the coordinating committee the student's academic preparation is inadequate, the student may be required to complete some courses in addition to the courses that are used to satisfy the requirements for the specialization.,Although separate interdepartmental graduate specializations in applied developmental science have been developed for master's and doctoral students, a given student may receive certification of completion of , the specialization for master's students or the specialization for doctoral students, but not for both of the specializations.  If a student has completed some of the requirements for the specialization that is available to master's students, but is subsequently admitted to a doctoral program and plans to complete the requirements for the specialization that is available to doctoral students, the requirements that the student has completed may be counted toward the requirements for the specialization that is available to doctoral students.,The student and the major professor select a guidance committee that will oversee the student's program of study for the specialization. In the event that a guidance committee has responsibility for overseeing a student's master's degree program, that same guidance committee may also oversee the student's program of study for the specialization, provided that the membership of the committee has been expanded to include at least one additional person who is a member of the applied developmental science faculty and who will represent that faculty on the committee.  The same guidance committee that has responsibility for overseeing a student's Educational Specialist or doctoral degree program may also oversee the student's program of study for the specialization, provided that the membership of the committee has been expanded to include at least two additional persons who are members of the applied developmental science faculty and who will represent that faculty on the committee.  For those students who are enrolled in master's degree programs that do not require that a guidance committee be established to oversee the student's program; for students who are enrolled in the graduate–professional degree program in the College of Human Medicine; and for master's, Educational Specialist, and doctoral students for whom guidance committees will be established for the sole purpose of overseeing programs of study for the specializations, the coordinator for applied developmental science will be responsible for establishing the students' guidance committees.,Students who are pursuing interdepartmental graduate specializations in applied developmental science are strongly encouraged to participate in twice monthly seminars with members of the applied developmental science faculty and other students who are pursuing the specializations.  At those seminars, faculty and invited guests address issues related to design, methodology, statistical analysis of longitudinal data, evaluation, and techniques for building community–university research collaborations.,The student must:,In addition to meeting the requirements referenced above, the thesis of a student on Plan A must reflect the integration of the student's discipline and applied developmental science.,The student must:,Students who are enrolled in the Educational Specialist degree program in the Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology and Special Education and students who are enrolled in the graduate–professional degree program in the College of Human Medicine must meet the requirements for the specialization that are specified for master's students on Plan B.,The courses that are used to satisfy the requirements for an Interdepartmental Graduate Specialization in Applied Developmental Science must be approved by the student's guidance committee for the specialization.  The courses should be selected within the context of the student's educational and career goals and with the goal of demonstrating competence in developmental systems theory, research methods, and quantitative and qualitative analytic methods.,GROUP A:  HUMAN DEVELOPMENT EMPHASIS,The courses listed below treat human development from a multidisciplinary perspective.  The student must complete a minimum of three courses totaling at least 9 credits. ,GROUP B:  STATISTICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL EMPHASIS,The courses listed below treat methodology and statistics applicable to research in applied developmental science.  The student must complete a minimum of three courses totaling at least 9 credits. , ","[<Selector xpath='//*[@id=""MainContent_divDesc""]/div/div[2]/ol' data='<ol>\r\n    <li>Provide an opportunity ...'>, <Selector xpath='//*[@id=""MainContent_divDesc""]/div/div[2]/ol' data='<ol>\r\n    <li>Complete 18 credits of ...'>, <Selector xpath='//*[@id=""MainContent_divDesc""]/div/div[2]/ol' data='<ol>\r\n    <li>Complete 18 credits of ...'>]",,

and in the graduate–professional degree program in the College of Human Medicine.,The College of Social Science administers the specializations.  The specializations are supervised by an interdisciplinary faculty coordinating committee representing the graduate programs involved.  Students must meet the requirements of both the degree program and the specialization.  Students should work closely with their academic advisors to ensure that meaningful experiences that are directly related to applied developmental science are included in their degree programs.  With the approval of the department or school and college that administer the student's degree program, the courses that are used to satisfy the requirements for the specialization may also be used to satisfy the requirements for the student's degree program.  ,American society is faced with pervasive and burgeoning problems of individuals, families, and communities.  Issues of child and youth development, of economic competitiveness, of environmental quality, and of health and health care require creative research and the design, deployment, and evaluation of innovative public policies and intervention programs.  As a consequence, there has been increasing societal pressure for universities, and for the scholars within them, to design and deliver knowledge applications addressing these problems.,One of the most fruitful areas for such knowledge application involves examining the problems of individuals and communities across the life span.  These applications require the ability to understand and assist the development of individuals who vary with respect to cultural and ethnic background, economic and social opportunity, physical and cognitive abilities, and conditions of living.  Infants at biopsychosocial risk, gifted children or those with developmental disabilities, adolescents considering health–compromising behaviors, single– and dual–worker parents, the frail elderly, ethnic minorities, and impoverished families are just some of the populations requiring applications of knowledge based on the work of scholars in fields such as criminal justice, human nutrition, medicine, and psychology.  There is a need within those fields for scholars who adopt a development perspective to their science.,The five components of applied developmental science are described below:, theory deals with the continuities and discontinuities of development, i.e., with the process of change.  There is a temporal component to individual, family, institutional, and community experiences.  Some aspects of development remain stable over time; other aspects change.  Systems theory provides an approach to modeling stability and change, and to the identification of factors that causally influence organizational processes.  The temporality of change has important implications for research design, service provision, and program evaluation because it is dependent upon use of longitudinal methods and keyed by multivariate models of the developmental process., involves issues related to diversity, whether that diversity is generated by culture, gender, age, socioeconomic status, disability, race or ethnicity, or community.  All of those factors potentially affect individual differences among persons, families, communities, and neighborhoods and potentially contribute to program successes and failures.  Competence in diversity refers to a set of academic and interpersonal skills that allow individuals to increase their understanding and appreciation of cultural differences and similarities within, among, and between groups., involves the centrality of context in terms of individuals, families, and family functioning.  Context exists at all levels—biological, physical/ecological, social–cultural, political, economic, etc., and invites systemic approaches to research and program design and implementation.  Contextual variables such as poverty, family size, birth order, single parenthood, supplemental child care, parental psychopathology, unemployment, and workplace stress all help to set the context within which individuals, families, and social groups behave and develop., emphasizes identification of assets so that the capacity to act is strengthened at the most basic level possible, whether that level is the individual person, or a local school, human service agency, neighborhood, or community.  Applied developmental science stresses normative developmental processes as primary prevention rather than remediation.  It rejects deficit model approaches to individual and social preventive–interventions.  Universities exist to disseminate knowledge through instruction.  From an applied developmental science perspective, asset building requires the learner (community) to be implicitly involved in the development of educational programs so that there is an explicit match between educational materials and needs of the consumer., stresses the principle that models for community intervention must be tested in the community setting in full collaboration with community partners.  In short, communities must participate as full partners in the design and evaluation of community programs.  From this perspective, application of knowledge generates new questions that demand generation of new knowledge (i.e., new approaches, new strategies, new program designs).  The activities of applied developmental science span a continuum of knowledge generation to knowledge application which includes, but is not limited to, research on the applicability of scientific theory to human growth and development in ecologically valid contexts; the study of developmental correlates of phenomena of social import; the construction and utilization of developmentally and contextually sensitive assessment instruments; the design and evaluation of developmental interventions and enhancement programs; and the dissemination of developmental knowledge to individuals, families, communities, practitioners, and policymakers through developmental education, written materials, the mass media, expert testimony, and community collaborations.,All of these five components converge to a research environment that values longitudinal designs by which one can track individuals over time, assess normative trends, evaluate different contextual influences on intraindividual change as well as normative trends, and assess the dynamic bi–directional processes that regulate organization of individual, dyadic, family, and social systems.,The interdepartmental graduate specializations in applied developmental science are designed to provide a knowledge base that will facilitate the work of graduates who pursue careers in educational, agency, institutional, and governmental organizations that are integral to preventive–intervention programs, longitudinal studies of human development, and developmental evaluation.  Specifically, the specializations are designed to:,A student who is enrolled in one of the master's, Educational Specialist, doctoral, or graduate–professional degree programs referenced above and who wishes to complete the requirements for an Interdepartmental Graduate Specialization in Applied Developmental Science must petition the admission committee for the specialization for acceptance.  To be considered for acceptance into the specialization, the student should have completed the Graduate Record Examination including the Subject Test in the student's discipline.  To be accepted into the specialization, the student must have had academic preparation in experimental design and statistical analysis.  If in the judgment of the coordinating committee the student's academic preparation is inadequate, the student may be required to complete some courses in addition to the courses that are used to satisfy the requirements for the specialization.,Although separate interdepartmental graduate specializations in applied developmental science have been developed for master's and doctoral students, a given student may receive certification of completion of , the specialization for master's students or the specialization for doctoral students, but not for both of the specializations.  If a student has completed some of the requirements for the specialization that is available to master's students, but is subsequently admitted to a doctoral program and plans to complete the requirements for the specialization that is available to doctoral students, the requirements that the student has completed may be counted toward the requirements for the specialization that is available to doctoral students.,The student and the major professor select a guidance committee that will oversee the student's program of study for the specialization. In the event that a guidance committee has responsibility for overseeing a student's master's degree program, that same guidance committee may also oversee the student's program of study for the specialization, provided that the membership of the committee has been expanded to include at least one additional person who is a member of the applied developmental science faculty and who will represent that faculty on the committee.  The same guidance committee that has responsibility for overseeing a student's Educational Specialist or doctoral degree program may also oversee the student's program of study for the specialization, provided that the membership of the committee has been expanded to include at least two additional persons who are members of the applied developmental science faculty and who will represent that faculty on the committee.  For those students who are enrolled in master's degree programs that do not require that a guidance committee be established to oversee the student's program; for students who are enrolled in the graduate–professional degree program in the College of Human Medicine; and for master's, Educational Specialist, and doctoral students for whom guidance committees will be established for the sole purpose of overseeing programs of study for the specializations, the coordinator for applied developmental science will be responsible for establishing the students' guidance committees.,Students who are pursuing interdepartmental graduate specializations in applied developmental science are strongly encouraged to participate in twice monthly seminars with members of the applied developmental science faculty and other students who are pursuing the specializations.  At those seminars, faculty and invited guests address issues related to design, methodology, statistical analysis of longitudinal data, evaluation, and techniques for building community–university research collaborations.,The student must:,In addition to meeting the requirements referenced above, the thesis of a student on Plan A must reflect the integration of the student's discipline and applied developmental science.,The student must:,Students who are enrolled in the Educational Specialist degree program in the Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology and Special Education and students who are enrolled in the graduate–professional degree program in the College of Human Medicine must meet the requirements for the specialization that are specified for master's students on Plan B.,The courses that are used to satisfy the requirements for an Interdepartmental Graduate Specialization in Applied Developmental Science must be approved by the student's guidance committee for the specialization.  The courses should be selected within the context of the student's educational and career goals and with the goal of demonstrating competence in developmental systems theory, research methods, and quantitative and qualitative analytic methods.,GROUP A:  HUMAN DEVELOPMENT EMPHASIS,The courses listed below treat human development from a multidisciplinary perspective.  The student must complete a minimum of three courses totaling at least 9 credits. ,GROUP B:  STATISTICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL EMPHASIS,The courses listed below treat methodology and statistics applicable to research in applied developmental science.  The student must complete a minimum of three courses totaling at least 9 credits. , ","[<Selector xpath='//*[@id=""MainContent_divDesc""]/div/div[2]/ol' data='<ol>\r\n    <li>Provide an opportunity ...'>, <Selector xpath='//*[@id=""MainContent_divDesc""]/div/div[2]/ol' data='<ol>\r\n    <li>Complete 18 credits of ...'>, <Selector xpath='//*[@id=""MainContent_divDesc""]/div/div[2]/ol' data='<ol>\r\n    <li>Complete 18 credits of ...'>]",,
